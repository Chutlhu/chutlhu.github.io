        Increasing interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, has occurred in recent years. Search and rescue scenarios where humans in emergency situations need to be quickly found in difficult-toaccess areas constitute an important field of application for this technology. Drones have already been used by humanitarian organizations in countries such as Haiti and the Philippines to map areas after a natural disaster using high-resolution embedded cameras, as documented in a recent United Nations report [1]. Although research efforts have focused mostly on developing video-based solutions for this task [2], UAV-embedded audio-based localization has received relatively less attention [3]?[7]. However, UAVs equipped with a microphone array could be of critical help to localize people in emergency situations, especially when video sensors are limited by a lack of visual feedback due to bad lighting conditions (such as at night or in fog) or obstacles limiting the field of view (Figure 1).

        'Acoustic echoes retrieval is a research topic that is gaining importance
        in many speech and audio signal processing applications such as speech enhancement,
        source separation, dereverberation and room geometry estimation.
        This work proposes a novel approach to retrieve acoustic echoes timing *off-grid* and blindly,
        i.e., from a stereophonic recording of an unknown sound source such as speech.
        It builds on the recent framework of continuous dictionaries.
        In contrast with existing methods, the proposed approach does not
        rely on parameter tuning nor peak picking techniques by working directly
        in the parameter space of interest. The accuracy and robustness of
        the method are assessed on challenging simulated setups with
        varying noise and reverberation levels and are compared to two state-of-the-art methods.'

- abstract: 'Live concert recordings consist in long multitrack audio samples with
    significant interferences between channels.
    For audio engineering purposes, it is desirable to attenuate those interferences.
    Recently, we proposed an algorithm to this end based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization,
    that iteratively estimate the clean power spectral densities of the sources
    and the strength of each in each microphone signal, encoded in an interference
    matrix.
    Although it behaves well, this method is too demanding computationally
    for full-length concerts lasting more than one hour.
    In this paper, we show how random projections of the data can be leveraged
    for effective estimation of the parameters. Interference reduction with these
    ideas
    can be achieved on full-length live multi-track recordings in an acceptable
    time and could be used by sound engineers. We demonstrate the efficiency of this

- abstract: In live multitrack recordings, each voice is usually captured by dedicated
    close microphones. Unfortunately, it is also captured in practice by other microphones
    intended for other sources, leading to so-called "interferences". Reducing this
    interference is desirable because it opens new perspectives for the engineering
    of live recordings. Hence, it has been the topic of recent research in audio processing.
    In this paper, we show how a Gaussian probabilistic framework may be set up for
    obtaining good isolation of the target sources. Doing so, we extend several state-of-the
    art methods by fixing some heuristic parts of their algorithms. As we show in
    a perceptual evaluation on real-world multitrack live recordings, the resulting
    principled techniques yield improved quality.
