- abstract: 'It is commonly observed that acoustic echoes hurt performance of sound
    source localization (SSL) methods.
    We introduce the concept of microphone array augmentation with echoes (MIRAGE)
    and show how estimation of early-echo  characteristics can in fact benefit SSL.
    We propose a learning based scheme for echo estimation combined with a physics based
    scheme for echo aggregation.
    In a simple scenario involving 2 microphones close to a reflective surface and
    one source,
    we show using simulated data that the proposed approach performs similarly to
    a correlation-based method
    in azimuth estimation while retrieving elevation as well from 2 microphones only,
    an impossible task in anechoic settings.'

- abstract: 'Live concert recordings consist in long multitrack audio samples with
    significant interferences between channels.
    For audio engineering purposes, it is desirable to attenuate those interferences.
    Recently, we proposed an algorithm to this end based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization,
    that iteratively estimate the clean power spectral densities of the sources
    and the strength of each in each microphone signal, encoded in an interference
    matrix.
    Although it behaves well, this method is too demanding computationally
    for full-length concerts lasting more than one hour.
    In this paper, we show how random projections of the data can be leveraged
    for effective estimation of the parameters. Interference reduction with these
    ideas
    can be achieved on full-length live multi-track recordings in an acceptable
    time and could be used by sound engineers. We demonstrate the efficiency of this
    approach on
    real full-length live recordings from the Montreux Jazz Festival and also provide
    an implementation of the method.'

- abstract: In live multitrack recordings, each voice is usually captured by dedicated
    close microphones. Unfortunately, it is also captured in practice by other microphones
    intended for other sources, leading to so-called "interferences". Reducing this
    interference is desirable because it opens new perspectives for the engineering
    of live recordings. Hence, it has been the topic of recent research in audio processing.
    In this paper, we show how a Gaussian probabilistic framework may be set up for
    obtaining good isolation of the target sources. Doing so, we extend several state-of-the
    art methods by fixing some heuristic parts of their algorithms. As we show in
    a perceptual evaluation on real-world multitrack live recordings, the resulting
    principled techniques yield improved quality.
