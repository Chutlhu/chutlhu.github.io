        In the context of building acoustics and the acoustic diagnosis of an existing room, it introduces and investigates a new approach to estimate the mean absorption coefficients solely from a room impulse response (RIR). 
        This inverse problem is tackled via virtually supervised learning, namely, the RIR-to-absorption mapping is implicitly learned by regression on a simulated dataset using artificial neural networks. 
        Simple models based on well-understood architectures are the focus of this work. The critical choices of geometric, acoustic, and simulation parameters, which are used to train the models, are extensively discussed and studied while keeping in mind the conditions that are representative of the field of building acoustics.
        Estimation errors from the learned neural models are compared to those obtained with classical formulas that require knowledge of the room's geometry and reverberation times. Extensive comparisons made on a variety of simulated test sets highlight different conditions under which the learned models can overcome the well-known limitations of the diffuse sound field hypothesis underlying these formulas.
        Results obtained on real RIRs measured in an acoustically configurable room show that at 1 kHz and above, the proposed approach performs comparably to classical models when reverberation times can be reliably estimated and continues to work even when they cannot.

        This paper presents a new dataset of measured multichannel room impulse responses (RIRs) named dEchorate. 
        It includes annotations of early echo timings and 3D positions of microphones, real sources, and image sources under different wall configurations in a cuboid room. These data provide a tool for benchmarking recent methods in echo-aware speech enhancement, room geometry estimation, RIR estimation, acoustic echo retrieval, microphone calibration, echo labeling, and reflector position estimation. The dataset is provided with software utilities to easily access, manipulate, and visualize the data as well as baseline methods for echo-related tasks.

        Increasing interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, has occurred in recent years.
        Search and rescue scenarios where humans in emergency situations need to be quickly found in difficult to access areas constitute
        an important field of application for this technology.
        Drones have already been used by humanitarian organizations in countries such as Haiti and
        the Philippines to map areas after a natural disaster using high-resolution embedded cameras,
        as documented in a recent United Nations report [1].
        Although research efforts have focused mostly on developing video-based solutions for this task [2],
        UAV-embedded audio-based localization has received relatively less attention [3-7].
        However, UAVs equipped with a microphone array could be of critical help to localize people in emergency situations,
        especially when video sensors are limited by a lack of visual feedback due to bad lighting conditions
        (such as at night or in fog) or obstacles limiting the field of view (Figure 1).

        This paper describes speech enhancement for realtime automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real environments. A standard approach to this task is to use neural beamforming that can work efficiently in an online manner. It estimates the masks of clean dry speech from a noisy echoic mixture spectrogram with a deep neural network (DNN) and then computes a enhancement filter used for beamforming. The performance of such a supervised approach, however, is drastically degraded under mismatched conditions. This calls for run-time adaptation of the DNN. Although the ground-truth speech spectrogram required for adaptation is not available at run time, blind dereverberation and separation methods such as weighted prediction error (WPE) and fast multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (FastMNMF) can be used for generating pseudo groundtruth data from a mixture. Based on this idea, a prior work proposed a dual-process system based on a cascade of WPE and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming asynchronously fine-tuned by block-online FastMNMF. To integrate the dereverberation capability into neural beamforming and make it fine-tunable at run time, we propose to use weighted power minimization distortionless response (WPD) beamforming, a unified version of WPE and minimum power distortionless response (MPDR), whose joint dereverberation and denoising filter is estimated using a DNN. We evaluated the impact of run-time adaptation under various conditions with different numbers of speakers, reverberation times, and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

        Acoustic echoes retrieval is a research topic that is gaining importance
        in many speech and audio signal processing applications such as speech enhancement,
        source separation, dereverberation and room geometry estimation.
        This work proposes a novel approach to retrieve acoustic echoes timing *off-grid* and blindly,
        i.e., from a stereophonic recording of an unknown sound source such as speech.
        It builds on the recent framework of continuous dictionaries.
        In contrast with existing methods, the proposed approach does not
        rely on parameter tuning nor peak picking techniques by working directly
        in the parameter space of interest. The accuracy and robustness of
        the method are assessed on challenging simulated setups with
        varying noise and reverberation levels and are compared to two state-of-the-art methods.

        This paper describes a statistically principled method that simultaneously localizes and separates multiple sound sources using multiple calibrated microphone arrays distributed in a room. Given the extensive research on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with a single microphone array, for 3D source localization, one may attempt triangulation based on DOAs separately and egocentrically estimated by multiple arrays. However, in multiple sources scenarios, this cascading approach faces both the inter-array DOA association problem and the error accumulation problem. To solve these problems, we propose a spatially regularized extension of a versatile blind source separation method called multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF). Our method treats multiple microphone arrays as a single big array and puts priors on the frequency-wise spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of each source. These priors are defined using the source DOA computed from the 3D positions of the source and arrays. The power spectral densities (PSDs), SCMs, and positions of multiple sources are jointly estimated under the unified maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) principle. We show the effectiveness of the joint statistical estimation for real data recorded by four five-channel microphone arrays of Microsoft Azure Kinect.

        We address the problem of accurately interpolating measured anechoic steering vectors with a deep learning framework called the neural field. This task plays a pivotal role in reducing the resource-intensive measurements required for precise sound source separation and localization, essential as the front-end of speech recognition. Classical approaches to interpolation rely on linear weighting of nearby measurements in space on a fixed, discrete set of frequencies. Drawing inspiration from the success of neural fields for novel view synthesis in computer vision, we introduce the neural steerer, a continuous complex-valued function that takes both frequency and direction as input and produces the corresponding steering vector. Importantly, it incorporates inter-channel phase difference information and a regularization term enforcing filter causality, essential for accurate steering vector modeling. Our experiments, conducted using a dataset of real measured steering vectors, demonstrate the effectiveness of our resolution-free model in interpolating such measurements.

        Identifying changes in a pair of 3D aerial LiDAR point
        clouds, obtained during two distinct time periods over the
        same geographic region presents a significant challenge due
        to the disparities in spatial coverage and the presence of
        noise in the acquisition system. The most commonly used
        approaches to detecting changes in point clouds are based
        on supervised methods which necessitate extensive labelled
        data often unavailable in real-world applications. To ad-
        dress these issues, we propose an unsupervised approach
        that comprises two components: Implcit Neural Represena-
        tion (INR) for continuous shape reconstruction and a Gaus-
        sian Mixture Model for categorising changes. INR offers a
        grid-agnostic representation for encoding bi-temporal point
        clouds, with unmatched spatial support that can be regu-
        larised to enhance high-frequency details and reduce noise.
        The reconstructions at each timestamp are compared at ar-
        bitrary spatial scales, leading to a significant increase in
        detection capabilities. We apply our method to a benchmark
        dataset comprising simulated LiDAR point clouds for ur-
        ban sprawling. This dataset encompasses diverse challeng-
        ing scenarios, varying in resolutions, input modalities and
        noise levels. This enables a comprehensive multi-scenario
        evaluation, comparing our method with the current state-of-
        the-art approach. We outperform the previous methods by
        a margin of 10% in the intersection over union metric. In
        addition, we put our techniques to practical use by applying
        them in a real-world scenario to identify instances of illicit
        excavation of archaeological sites and validate our results
        by comparing them with findings from field experts.

        This paper revisits single-channel audio source separation based on a probabilistic generative model of a mixture signal defined in the continuous time domain. We assume that each source signal follows a non-stationary Gaussian process (GP), i.e., any finite set of sampled points follows a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is governed by a kernel function over time-varying latent variables. The mixture signal composed of such source signals thus follows a GP whose covariance matrix is given by the sum of the source covariance matrices. To estimate the latent variables from the mixture signal, we use a deep neural network with an encoder-separator-decoder architecture (e.g., Conv-TasNet) that separates the latent variables in a pseudo-time-frequency space. The key feature of our method is to feed the latent variables into the kernel function for estimating the source covariance matrices, instead of using the decoder for directly estimating the time-domain source signals. This enables the decomposition of a mixture signal into the source signals with a classical yet powerful Wiener filter that considers the full covariance structure over all samples. The kernel function and the network are trained jointly in the maximum likelihood framework. Comparative experiments using two-speech mixtures under clean, noisy, and noisy-reverberant conditions from the WSJ0-2mix, WHAM!, and WHAMR! benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed method performed well and outperformed the baseline method under noisy and noisy-reverberant conditions.

        This paper introduces a theoretically-rigorous sound source localization (SSL) method based on a robust extension of the classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The original SSL method estimates the noise eigenvectors and the MUSIC spectrum by computing the spatial covariance matrix of the observed multichannel signal and then detects the peaks from the spectrum. In this work, the covariance matrix is replaced with the positive definite shape matrix originating from the elliptically contoured α-stable model, which is more suitable under real noisy high-reverberant conditions. Evaluation on synthetic data shows that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods under such adverse conditions, while it is comparable on real data recorded in a mild acoustic condition.

        This work tackles the problem of resolving high-resolution velocity fields from a set of sparse off-grid observations. This task, crucial in many applications spanning from experimental fluiddynamics to compute vision and medicine, can be addressed with deep neural network models trained to employ physics-based constraints. This work proposes an original unsupervised deep learning framework involving sub-grid models that improve the accuracy of super-resolved instantaneous and sparse velocity fields of turbulent flows.

      text: This paper describes a method for estimating the room impulse response (RIR) for a microphone and a sound source located at arbitrary positions from the 3D mesh data of the room. Simulating realistic RIRs with pure physics-driven methods often fails the balance between physical consistency and computational efficiency, hindering application to real time speech processing. Alternatively, one can use MESH2IR, a fast black-box estimator that consists of an encoder extracting latent code from mesh data with a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a decoder generating the RIR from the latent code. Combining these two approaches, we propose a fast yet physically coherent estimator with interpretable latent code based on differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP). Specifically, the encoder estimates a virtual shoebox room scene that acoustically approximates the real scene, accelerating physical simulation with the differentiable image-source model in the decoder. Our experiments showed that our method outperformed MESH2IR for real mesh data obtained with the depth scanner of Microsoft HoloLens 2, and can provide correct spatial consistency for binaural RIRs.

        It is commonly observed that acoustic echoes hurt performance of sound
        source localization (SSL) methods.
        We introduce the concept of microphone array augmentation with echoes (MIRAGE)
        and show how estimation of early-echo  characteristics can in fact benefit SSL.
        We propose a learning based scheme for echo estimation combined with a physics based
        scheme for echo aggregation.
        In a simple scenario involving 2 microphones close to a reflective surface and
        one source,
        we show using simulated data that the proposed approach performs similarly to
        a correlation-based method
        in azimuth estimation while retrieving elevation as well from 2 microphones only,
        an impossible task in anechoic settings.

        It is commonly believed that multipath hurts various audio process-ing
        algorithms.At odds with this belief, we show that multipath in fact helps sound
        source separation,even with very simple propagation models.Unlike most existing
        methods, we neither ignore the room impulse responses, nor we attempt to estimate
        them fully. Weather  assume  that  we  know  the  positions  of  a  few  virtual
         micro-phones generated by echoes and we show how this gives us enough spatial
        diversity to get a performance boost over the anechoic case.We show improvements
        for two standard algorithms\u2014one that uses only magnitudes of the transfer
        functions, and one that also uses the phases.Concretely, we show that multichannel
        non-negative matrix factorization aided with a small number of echoes beats the
        vanilla variant of the same algorithm, and that with magnitude information only,
        echoes enable separation where it was previously impossible

- title: Interference reduction on full-length live recordings
  abstract: 'Live concert recordings consist in long multitrack audio samples with
    significant interferences between channels.
    For audio engineering purposes, it is desirable to attenuate those interferences.
    Recently, we proposed an algorithm to this end based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization,
    that iteratively estimate the clean power spectral densities of the sources
    and the strength of each in each microphone signal, encoded in an interference
    matrix.
    Although it behaves well, this method is too demanding computationally
    for full-length concerts lasting more than one hour.
    In this paper, we show how random projections of the data can be leveraged
    for effective estimation of the parameters. Interference reduction with these
    ideas
    can be achieved on full-length live multi-track recordings in an acceptable
    time and could be used by sound engineers. We demonstrate the efficiency of this
    approach on
    real full-length live recordings from the Montreux Jazz Festival and also provide
    an implementation of the method.'

- title: Gaussian framework for interference reduction in live recordings
  abstract: In live multitrack recordings, each voice is usually captured by dedicated
    close microphones. Unfortunately, it is also captured in practice by other microphones
    intended for other sources, leading to so-called "interferences". Reducing this
    interference is desirable because it opens new perspectives for the engineering
    of live recordings. Hence, it has been the topic of recent research in audio processing.
    In this paper, we show how a Gaussian probabilistic framework may be set up for
    obtaining good isolation of the target sources. Doing so, we extend several state-of-the
    art methods by fixing some heuristic parts of their algorithms. As we show in
    a perceptual evaluation on real-world multitrack live recordings, the resulting
    principled techniques yield improved quality.

  abstract: >
    Most of audio signal processing methods regard reverberation and in particular acoustic echoes as a nuisance. However, they convey important spatial and semantic information about sound sources and, based on this, recent echo-aware methods have been proposed. In this work, we focus on two directions. First, we study how to estimate acoustic echoes blindly from microphone recordings. Two approaches are proposed, one leveraging on continuous dictionaries, one using recent deep learning techniques. Then, we focus on extending existing methods in audio scene analysis to their echo-aware forms. The Multichannel NMF framework for audio source separation, the SRP-PHAT localization method, and the MVDR beamformer for speech enhancement are all extended to their echo-aware versions.
