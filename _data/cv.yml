    description: Developed algorithms for the computation of the continuous Haar, Fourier and cosine transforms of rectilinear polygons found in IC layouts. Derived the theoretical computational complexity. Implemented the algorithms in a lithography tool and benchmarked against discrete transforms.  Investigated the sparsity of the representation of the polygons in Haar basis and its application to the pattern analysis of IC layouts. Outcome resulted in scientific articles, highly optimized software and patents filing.
