Building microphone arrays with hundreds or more sensors, or covering large
areas (think square kilometric) is a challenging task. Typically, conventional
wired and wireless architectures fail to scale up. Instead of classic
microphones, we created blinkies, small sensors with just a cpu, a microphone
and an LED.  The LED is modulated according to the sound intensity and the
signals from a large number of sensors are easily acquired by filming the scene
with a video camera. We plan on showing that the signals from the LED is useful
for a variety of tasks, e.g. source localization, improve beamforming (together
with a classic mic array), scene analysis, light-aided source separation.

This is a joint research project with Nobutaka Ono (TMU).
