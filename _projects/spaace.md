BIODESIGN for the REAL WORLD is a transdisciplinary and collaborative research
project addressing water quality with partners in Switzerland,
[(Art)ScienceBLR](http://artscienceblr.org/) in India, and
[Lifepatch](http://lifepatch.org/) in Indonesia.

BIO-DESIGN for the REAL WORLD explores how biology and biotechnology can be designed within social contexts.

As a powerful technological medium after industrial and digital revolutions,
implementation and design solutions for biology and biotechnology must reflect
a diversity of voices to be meaningful in society, not only to be guided by
concerns of a few.

We are interested in
* Real world problems
* Horizontal exchange
* Open and transdisciplinary approach
