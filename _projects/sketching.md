It has been shown recently that random projections is an efficient technique to
reduce the cost of solving large least-squares systems. The recursive least
squares (RLS) adaptive filter converges fast but suffers from a high
computational cost.  We show that sketching helps alleviate the computations at
the cost of a mild decrease in convergences speed that can be controlled.
