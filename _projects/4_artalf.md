ARTalƒ is  **real-time augmented music visualization** of an album cover synchronized with the music of the album itself. It is the results of a combination of simple *music information retrieval* and *image segmentation* algorithm with *augmented reality*.

In practice:

1. Colors and shapes are detected in the album picture
2. Pitch, rhythm timber information is extracted by the audio
3. A new multimedia content is added to the real image
4. Such contents are selected according to the colors and animated according to the music

This project was realized as project for the _Multimedia Programming_ course of the MSc SMC2016 at Aalborg University.

Music: Massive by Mandela<br>
Idea: *Meet the soundtrack* in Fantasia by Disney + fever trip
