ODD~STRING is one of the many steps made towards extending string instruments such as electric guitar or bass.
It was developed having in mind the difficulties players have when approaching new interfaces, since sometimes it can be quite hard to adapt.
For this reason, ODD~STRING is designed so that it extends the player capabilities with as few limitations as possible.
We hope ODD~STRING can be used in real live performances by great artists.

Designed, developed, coded and built together with Jorge Madrid Portillo.

This project was realized as project for the _Real-Time Interaction and Performance_ course of the MSc SMC2016 at Aalborg University.
