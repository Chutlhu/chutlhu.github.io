_Short bio... but now a bit longer_

#### As you may have noticed

My name is Diego <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Di Carlo</span> and I come from [Vicenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicenza).

Since October 2017 I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/centre/rennes) in the [PANAMA team](https://team.inria.fr/panama/) in the beautiful city of Rennes, France.<br>
Under the supervision of [Antoine <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Deleforge</span>](https://members.loria.fr/ADeleforge/) and [Nancy <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Bertin</span>](https://people.irisa.fr/Nancy.Bertin/en), we are shedding light on how **acoustic echoes helps indoor audio signal processing** and how (and if) it is possible to estimated them.

#### Primordial Soup

I graduated in Compute Engineering in 2017 from [Universit√° degli Studi di Padova](https://www.dei.unipd.it/) with a thesis on [*Music Interference Reduction with Gaussian Process*](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01515971/document). This worked was supervided by Nicola <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Orio</span> and Antoine <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Liutkus</span> and it was conducted while I was at Multispeech Team in INIRA Nancy France.

Before of this... well *Hic Sunt Dracones*.

<!-- In my thesis I am exploring the indoor environment wearing a blindfold asking myself:

1. _Where does this sound comes from?_
2. _Can I better focus on this sound?_
3. _What is the shape of the room around me_
4. _How can I hone these skills?_

The key object to answer this question if the **room impulse response**, a filter, -->


<!-- # Introduction of my thesis


In fact, when the sound propagates in a indoor environment, it interacts. You can see this
when your super rich friend does a cannonball in his private pool (of his amazing villa, of course):
Please, look away from the greek statues judging your body athleticism.
Now focus on the water surface, like your eyes where slow motion cameras: BULLET TIME!

suspance

Now, the impact; dont let it goes. Observe.
The water elongates its liquid jaws and swallow your friend. Impressionistic splashes
spread around. Your friend now is just a distorted and glitched shape in a dense jelly.

Like in a 19th century ballet, bothered by main character, your friend, the wave crests curve away in all directions and flee to the poolside.
Their trot is bounced back elastically at the scene extremes.
Thus, they all meet again in the middle, they bump and proceed towards the other extreme.
You feel you missed couple of instants and all the scene is chaotic. So does the pool:
waves are moving, your friend is re-emerging and he is slashing the water surface ... chaotic.

Wait just another few instants and everything seems fading aways as your friend calms down and reach the poolside.
Without his exuberance, the water calms down returning to its original placid steady state.

This motion picture served to showed you how sound (water waves) propagates in a closed environment (pool).
We can identify some elements:

- the _source_: the impact of your friend

- _environment_:

-

like a ball on a Billiard table.

I am currently working on estimating early acoustic echoes for audio inverse problem.


As in Ken the Surivor and in Sampei: **to be continued.** -->

<!-- focusing on data and signals.  My research interests have taken me from
[proving theorems](/sparse_hadamard) to literally jumping in a cold
mountain lake to [sample its water](/biodesign), checking for the presence
of arsenic. When I work on a problem, I want to take it from the idea all
the way to the implementation into a [physical prototype](/microphone_arrays).

Currently, I live in [Tokyo](http://www.comp.sd.tmu.ac.jp/onolab/onono-e.html)
and work on the theory and applications of large scale ad hoc arrays of
acoustic sensors. I use small [sound-to-light conversion sensors](/otohikari) and
film them with a camera.

I am the main contributor to [Pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics),
a Python package for room simulation and audio array processing. The
package lets the user easily create acoustic scenarios and simulate the
propagation between sources and microphones.

I got my B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) in
Switzerland. I was lucky enough to be a member of the awesome [Audiovisual
Communications Laboratory](http://lcav.epfl.ch) from 2012 to 2017. Before
that, I worked for NEC in Japan, and IBM Research in Switzerland.

In my free time, I like to create electronics gadgets. I am an early
member of SAFECAST Japan where I build mobile Geiger counters to
monitor the fallout from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear accident. I
co-founded the [biodesign for the real-world](http://biodesign.cc) project. -->
