**TL;DR I am Robin Scheibler, a researcher working more often than not on
audio processing and stuff. I like coding and making hardware, and I like
it open source. Some people call me a hacker.**

_Long version:_ My name is Robin Scheibler and I am a researcher
focusing on data and signals.  My research interests have taken me from
[proving theorems](/sparse_hadamard) to literally jumping in a cold
mountain lake to [sample its water](/biodesign), checking for the presence
of arsenic. When I work on a problem, I want to take it from the idea all
the way to the implementation into a [physical prototype](/microphone_arrays).

Currently, I live in [Tokyo](http://www.comp.sd.tmu.ac.jp/onolab/onono-e.html)
and work on the theory and applications of large scale ad hoc arrays of
acoustic sensors. I use small [sound-to-light conversion sensors](/otohikari) and
film them with a camera.

I am the main contributor to [Pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics),
a Python package for room simulation and audio array processing. The
package lets the user easily create acoustic scenarios and simulate the
propagation between sources and microphones.

I got my B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) in
Switzerland. I was lucky enough to be a member of the awesome [Audiovisual
Communications Laboratory](http://lcav.epfl.ch) from 2012 to 2017. Before
that, I worked for NEC in Japan, and IBM Research in Switzerland.

In my free time, I like to create electronics gadgets. I am an early
member of SAFECAST Japan where I build mobile Geiger counters to
monitor the fallout from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear accident. I
co-founded the [biodesign for the real-world](http://biodesign.cc) project.
