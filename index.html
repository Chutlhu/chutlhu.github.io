    TLDR; I am Robin Scheibler, a researcher working more often than not on
    audio processing and stuff. I like coding and making hardware, and I like
    it open source. Some people call me a hacker.

    <p>
    <i>Long version:</i> My name is Robin Scheibler and I am a researcher
    focusing on data and signals.  My research interests have taken me from
    proving theorems to literally jumping in a cold mountain lake to sample its
    water, checking for the presence of arsenic. When I work on a problem, I
    want to take it from the idea all the way to the implementation into a
    physical prototype. This aspect of my personality has the happy side effect
    of spawning collaborations across disciplines such as information theory,
    theoretical computer science, embedded systems, biology, and the hacker
    community at large.

    <p>
    I currently research blinky audio sensors at Tokyo Metropolitan University
    together with Nobutaka Ono. Before that I was a PhD studen and,
    shortly, postdoc at Martin Vetterli's laboratory at EPFL in Lausanne.
    During my time there, I investigated how structural aspects of sound
    propagation, the echoes in a room for example, can provide more robust and
    efficient algorithms for problems such as beamforming, direction of arrival, or
    source separation. In a different line of work, I apply techniques from
    information theory and theoretical computer science to provide low-complexity
    algorithms for signal processing problems. 

    <p>
    Before that, and in reverse chronological order, I was a researcher at NEC
    Corporation in Tokyo, at IBM Research in Z\"urich, 

    <p>
    He received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Communications Systems from EPFL in
    2009. Never longer than two years at a time in Lausanne, Robin visited
    Stockholm as an exchange student, spent a year at NEC Corporation in Tokyo,
    and wrote his master thesis at IBM Research, ZÃ¼rich.

    <p>
    He had returned to Tokyo when the Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami of
    March 2011 struck and crippled the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear power plant.
    In the wake of the disaster, Robin joined Safecast to develop its first
    mobile radiation sensor system. The system was ultimately used to provide
    the most extensive radiation measurement database available today.

    <p>
    He continues to be active in environmental monitoring through the Biodesign
    for the Real-World project.
