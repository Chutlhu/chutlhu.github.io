## Experience

### [EDIC](http://phd.epfl.ch/page-19698.html), Swiss Insititue of Technology, Lausanne ([EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch)), Switzerland

September 2012 - Present

_PhD Candidate_ - Focus on processing and sensing of environmental data.

### [SAFECAST Japan](http://www.safecast.org/), Tokyo, Japan

March 2011 - Present

_bGeigie dude_ - Volunteer, designing, manufacturing and writing firmware for
car-borne geo-tagged radiation measurement devices as part of a grass-root
initiative to monitor fallout from the Fukushima Dai-ichi triple meltdown of
March 2011.

### [NEC Corporation](http://www.nec.com/), Kawasaki, Japan

Media & Information Processing Laboratory

January 2011 - August 2012

_Temporary Research Staff_ - Development of new algorithms for
single-microphone speech denoising techniques based on spectral subtraction for
application in consumer electronics. Specifically: speech harmonics preservation,
DCT-based spectral subtraction, wind noise suppression.

### [IBM Research - Zürch](http://www.zurich.ibm.com), Rüschlikon, Switzerland

Systems Software Group

February 2009 - September 2010

_Research Intern_ - Developed algorithms for the computation of the continuous Haar, Fourier and cosine transforms of rectilinear polygons found in IC layouts. Derived the theoretical computational complexity. Implemented the algorithms in a lithography tool and benchmarked against discrete transforms. Investigated the sparsity of the representation of the polygons in Haar basis and its application to the pattern analysis of IC layouts. Outcome resulted in scientific articles, highly optimized software and patents filing.
EPFL    Lausanne, Switzerland

### Computer Networks and Information Sciences classes, [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch)

September 2008 - January 2009

_Teaching Assistant_ - Helped students with pencil and paper exercises and during lab sessions. Assisted in the preparation of the lab sessions.

### [NEC Corporation](http://www.nec.com/), Kawasaki, Japan

System IP Core Laboratory

March 2007 - January 2008

_Research Intern_ - Implementation in Matlab of a 3GPP compliant simulator to evaluate the performance of different interference mitigation algorithms.  Implementation and performance evaluation of QRD-RLS interference mitigation for Wideband CDMA on a CORDIC-based reconfigurable systolic array for software-defined radio (SDR) applications. The result of this work was presented at a domestic SDR conference in Nagano, Japan.

### [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch), Lausanne, Switzerland

Laboratory for computer Communications and Applications (LCA2)

July 2006 - August 2008

_Student Assistant_ - Worked on various research projects in ultra wide band (UWB) networking and wireless communications at the Laboratory for computer Communications and Applications. This projects included the debugging and extension of the ns-2 implementation of a dynamic channel coding MAC protocol for an UWB physical layer; The implementation in C and Matlab of different packet detection and timing acquisition algorithms for an Impulse Radio UWB (IR-UWB) test platform; Creation of a new timing acquisition error probabilistic model for IR-UWB that was further used in localization algorithms.
