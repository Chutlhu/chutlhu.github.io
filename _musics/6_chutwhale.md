Ergodic Parasyte with Alpha Stable Heavy Tail on the Whale swimming backwards on the waterfall

My personal project... waiting for inspiration for uploading my stuff.


**Note**: Banner image, generated with CHATGPT with the following prompt:
```
A surreal illustration of a massive whale, its body split into two contrasting halves. 
The left side of the whale is heavily corrupted by parasitic organisms, featuring grotesque, organic growths, pulsating tendrils, and clusters of bioluminescent, alien-like spores.
The texture is slimy and organic, with colors ranging from sickly greens to glowing purples.
The right side is a biomechanical skeleton, displaying intricate metallic structures, glowing circuits, and exposed machinery interwoven with skeletal features.
The whale is swimming in an ominous, deep-sea environment, surrounded by murky water illuminated by faint beams of light breaking through the surface.
Shadows and light emphasize the eerie contrast between organic decay and technological perfection.
Created using: hyper-detailed biomechanical and organic fusion styles, eerie lighting, photorealistic textures, cinematic color grading, high-definition quality, natural and surrealistic aesthetic
